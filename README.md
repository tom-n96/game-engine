# Game Engine
RPG style game engine written in Java. Graphic assets are not included due to unknown copyright status.

<h2>Current state</h2>
Current features include 2 distinct methods for rendering sprites. New method is implemented, but not utilized.<br>
<br>
Basic engine framework is mostly intact for collision detection, movement, items, and enviroment mechanics. 
<br><br>
Maps are created in BMP form, with specified RGB values equating to certain materials in-game. This can be configured in the software, and allows use of bitmap editing software to function as "map editors".
<br><br>
This is mostly just an example of the engine's current progress and is not really useful for any serious game development in its current state.
